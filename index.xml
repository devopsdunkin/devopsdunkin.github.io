      <description>With the release of Terraform 0.12, one of the great, new features is dynamic blocks. I have been working on a Terraform module for our operations team to consume to build servers via a CI/CD pipeline and needed to allow them to provision an arbitary number of disks to each deployment.
Below, we define the dynamic block within the module itself. We pass in a variable, called disks_to_provision, which is a list of maps.</description>

      <description>For the past several months, I have spent several evenings learning how to write Go and how to create a Terraform provider. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a fun experience and it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to see that work starting to pay off. As of October 31, version 1.0.0 has been released! This version allows you to manage hosts, host groups, services and service groups within Nagios XI. The plan is to release several updates over the coming weeks that will add other resources and eventually data sources into the fold.</description>

      <description>My name&amp;rsquo;s Chris and I am an infrastructure engineer with 10+ years working in IT in various industries. I recently started a new job back in February 2019 that got me involved with a lot of new tools. As I have been learning more about them and this whole DevOps methodology, I have stumbled across many things that aren&amp;rsquo;t well documented in the wild. So I started this blog to help fill that gap.</description>
